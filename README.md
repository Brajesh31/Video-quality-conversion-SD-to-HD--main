## üéØ Project Overview

This project is a prototype of a video conversion process that efficiently upscales **SD resolution (640x480px)** videos to **HD resolution (1280x720px)**. It leverages traditional, fast interpolation techniques like cubic interpolation to resize video frames while maintaining the best possible quality.

A key feature of this tool is its ability to handle audio separately. It extracts the original audio from the source video, processes the video frames, and then seamlessly merges the preserved audio with the newly upscaled video, ensuring perfect synchronization.

## ‚ú® Core Features

* **High-Quality Interpolation:** Uses **Cubic Interpolation** via OpenCV for a smoother and higher-quality upscale compared to simpler methods.
* **Audio Preservation:** Extracts the original audio track using FFmpeg and flawlessly merges it with the upscaled video.
* **Efficient Processing:** Built with performance in mind, using optimized libraries to process videos in a reasonable amount of time.
* **Standard Formats:** Supports common input video formats and produces standard `.mp4` output files.
